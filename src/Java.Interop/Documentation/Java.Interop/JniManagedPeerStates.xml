      Managed peer is eligeable for activation.

    <remarks>
      <para>
        A managed peer is <i>activatable</i> if it the native peer was
        constructed first and a forthcoming constructor invocation is
        assumed to be forthcoming.

    <summary>
      Managed peer is replaceable.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>
        A managed peer is <i>replaceable</i> if it was created through
        <see cref="M:Java.Interop.JniRuntime+JniValueManager.CreatePeer" />.
        Being "replaceable" means that if another peer instance is created
        around the same Java instance, the newly created instance will replace
        the replaceable peer in the Java-to-managed instance mapping.
